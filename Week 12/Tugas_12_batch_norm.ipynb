        "To motivate batch normalization, let us review\n",
        "a few practical challenges that arise\n",
        "when training machine learning models and neural networks in particular.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, choices regarding data preprocessing often make an enormous difference in the final results.\n",
        "Recall our application of MLPs to predicting house prices (:numref:`sec_kaggle_house`).\n",
        "Our first step when working with real data\n",
        "was to standardize our input features\n",
        "to each have a mean of zero and variance of one.\n",
        "Intuitively, this standardization plays nicely with our optimizers\n",
        "because it puts the parameters *a priori* at a similar scale.\n",
        "   \n",
        "Second, for a typical MLP or CNN, as we train,\n",
        "the variables (e.g., affine transformation outputs in MLP)\n",
        "in intermediate layers \n",
        "may take values with widely varying magnitudes:\n",
        "both along the layers from the input to the output, across units in the same layer,\n",
        "and over time due to our updates to the model parameters.\n",
        "The inventors of batch normalization postulated informally\n",
        "that this drift in the distribution of such variables could hamper the convergence of the network.\n",
        "Intuitively, we might conjecture that if one\n",
        "layer has variable values that are 100 times that of another layer,\n",
        "this might necessitate compensatory adjustments in the learning rates.\n",
        "   \n",
        "Third, deeper networks are complex and easily capable of overfitting.\n",

        "\n",
        "Batch normalization is applied to individual layers\n",
        "(optionally, to all of them) and works as follows:\n",
        "In each training iteration,\n",
        "we first normalize the inputs (of batch normalization)\n",
        "by subtracting their mean and\n",
        "dividing by their standard deviation,\n",
        "where both are estimated based on the statistics of the current minibatch.\n",
        "Next, we apply a scale coefficient and a scale offset.\n",
        "It is precisely due to this *normalization* based on *batch* statistics\n",
        "that *batch normalization* derives its name.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that if we tried to apply batch normalization with minibatches of size 1,\n",
        "we would not be able to learn anything.\n",

        "each hidden unit would take value 0!\n",
        "As you might guess, since we are devoting a whole section to batch normalization,\n",
        "with large enough minibatches, the approach proves effective and stable.\n",
        "One takeaway here is that when applying batch normalization,\n",
        "the choice of batch size may be\n",
        "even more significant than without batch normalization.\n",

        "After applying standardization,\n",
        "the resulting minibatch\n",
        "has zero mean and unit variance.\n",
        "Because the choice of unit variance\n",
